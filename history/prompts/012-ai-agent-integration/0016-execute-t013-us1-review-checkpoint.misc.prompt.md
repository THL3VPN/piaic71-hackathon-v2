## Prompt

## User Input

```text
You are implementing Step 4 of a Todo AI Chatbot. Context: - Steps 1–3 are complete - Chat endpoint already exists with dummy logic - Task tools exist and are validated - Conversation and message persistence exists - Backend is FastAPI (async) Rules: - Do NOT modify DB models - Do NOT change auth logic - Do NOT bypass task tools - Chat must remain stateless - LLM provider must be configurable via env variables - No MCP server yet Task: - Add a model factory that selects provider (OpenAI or Gemini) via env vars - Build a single AI agent using OpenAI Agents SDK - Register task tools with the agent - Replace dummy assistant logic in POST /api/chat with agent execution - Capture tool calls and return them in the response
```

## Response snapshot

Recorded US1 review checkpoint and validated with unit test.

## Outcome
