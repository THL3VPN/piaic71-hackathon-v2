Feature: Backend service bootstrap (FastAPI)

User journeys
1.1 Start the backend service locally
1.2 Verify the service is running via a health endpoint

Acceptance criteria
2.1 The backend is implemented using Python FastAPI
2.2 The service starts successfully using uvicorn
2.3 An HTTP endpoint GET /health is available
2.4 The /health endpoint returns HTTP 200
2.5 The response body is a simple JSON object (e.g. { "status": "ok" })
2.6 No authentication is required
2.7 No database connection is required
2.8 The endpoint is accessible via http://localhost:<port>/health
2.9 All code uses Python 3.12+ type hints and clear docstrings

Success metrics
3.1 curl http://localhost:<port>/health returns HTTP 200
3.2 All pytest tests pass
3.3 Test coverage includes the /health endpoint
3.4 Code follows constitution rules


/sp plan

Create: architecture sketch, interfaces, data model, error handling, requirements.
Decisions needing: list important choices with options and tradeoffs.
Testing strategy: unit + integration tests based on acceptance criteria.

Technical details:
- Use a simple, functional approach where it makes sense
- Use Python FastAPI
- Follow TDD: write tests first, then implementation
- Organize code and tests according to your constitution rules



to test

export UV_PYTHON=python3.13
UV_PYTHON=python3.13 uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000
