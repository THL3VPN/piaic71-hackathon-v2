Feature: Frontend bootstrap with backend connectivity

User journeys
1.1 Start the frontend locally
1.2 Open the app in the browser via http://localhost:<port>
1.3 The homepage calls the backend /health endpoint and shows the result

Acceptance criteria
2.1 Frontend is built using Next.js 16+ with App Router
2.2 The frontend starts successfully (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
2.3 The homepage loads without runtime errors
2.4 The frontend makes an HTTP request to the backend (e.g., GET http://localhost:8000/health)
2.5 The backend response is displayed clearly on the page (e.g., “Backend: OK”)
2.6 CORS or proxy configuration is set so the request succeeds locally
2.7 README includes how to run both apps locally (ports + commands)
2.8 No authentication is required
2.9 No task CRUD UI is required in this step

Success metrics
3.1 Visiting http://localhost:<frontend_port> shows the UI and backend health status
3.2 Backend + frontend can run at the same time with no errors
3.3 (Optional) Frontend smoke test passes (or at least Next build succeeds)

/prompts:sp.plan

Create: architecture sketch, interfaces, data model, error handling, requirements.
Decisions needing: list important choices with options and tradeoffs.
Testing strategy: unit + integration tests based on acceptance criteria.
Technical details:
- Use a simple, functional approach where it makes sense
- Follow TDD: write tests first, then implementation
- Organize code and tests according to your constitution rules

/sp.tasks

Break plan into small tasks (T001..), each ≤ 3 minutes, testable, reversible.
Add dependencies between tasks; group into phases; mark deliverables per task. Group tasks by operations and for each operation like add use TDD approach so RED Tests, Green Tests and Refactor. After each group we pause for human review and on approval commit to github.

Focus on:
- TDD approach (tests first for each operation)
- Small, step-by-step implementation
- Clear task dependencies
- Easy to undo changes

/sp.implement

Rules: tests first, smallest diff, keep public API stable within a phase.
After each task: run tests, update checklist, note deltas to spec if needed Mark completed tasks in tasks.md


To run locally:
1. export UV_PYTHON=python3.13 && export UV_CACHE_DIR=... && uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000
2. In a second shell: cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000 to see the backend health card (the page proxies /api/health to port 8000).
