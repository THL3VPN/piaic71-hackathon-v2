Feature: Frontend tasks UI (unauthenticated, DB-backed)

User journeys
1.1 Open the web app and view all tasks
1.2 Add a new task from the UI
1.3 See the list update after adding

Acceptance criteria
2.1 The homepage (or /tasks) fetches tasks from the backend
2.2 Backend integration uses your existing API:
2.2.1 GET /api/tasks to list tasks
2.2.2 POST /api/tasks to create a task
2.3 UI shows tasks clearly:
2.3.1 title
2.3.2 completion status
2.3.3 optional description (if present)
2.4 UI provides a simple “Add Task” form (title required)
2.5 Validation: empty title shows a user-friendly error and does not submit
2.6 After creating a task, the list refreshes (optimistic update or refetch)
2.7 No authentication is required
2.8 Responsive layout works on mobile and desktop

Success metrics
3.1 Manual test: create a task in UI → it appears immediately and persists on refresh
3.2 No console errors during fetch/create
3.3 Backend tests remain green (no regressions)

/prompts:sp.plan

Create: architecture sketch, interfaces, data model, error handling, requirements.
Decisions needing: list important choices with options and tradeoffs.
Testing strategy: unit + integration tests based on acceptance criteria.
Technical details:
- Use a simple, functional approach where it makes sense
- Follow TDD: write tests first, then implementation
- Organize code and tests according to your constitution rules

/sp.tasks

Break plan into small tasks (T001..), each ≤ 3 minutes, testable, reversible.
Add dependencies between tasks; group into phases; mark deliverables per task. Group tasks by operations and for each operation like add use TDD approach so RED Tests, Green Tests and Refactor. After each group we pause for human review and on approval commit to github.

Focus on:
- TDD approach (tests first for each operation)
- Small, step-by-step implementation
- Clear task dependencies
- Easy to undo changes

/sp.implement

Rules: tests first, smallest diff, keep public API stable within a phase.
After each task: run tests, update checklist, note deltas to spec if needed Mark completed tasks in tasks.md
